          <p><h4>Welcome to my webpage</h4></p>
          
          <p>I am currently enrolled in the UNH Coding Bootcamp and excited to be adding this skill to 
             my business experience.
          </p>
          <P>I have lived in Maine for the almost 6 years with my wife and two children where we moved from 
            the North Shore of Massachusetts. I grew up in Lynn, Ma., and a graduate of Salem State College 
            in 2001 with a degree in History and Education. In 1999 I feel into banking working for Eastern 
            Bank working, and for over 20 years I have spent my career in community banking and financial 
            services where I have focused on my career on business banking, cash management, and retail 
            banking where I have had the opportunity to lead the these business lines.
          </p>
          <P> As a family in our share time we all train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at Nostos MMA in 
            Somersworth NH and have all competed. We all share a love for music where I enjoy 
            fiddling around on the guitar and bass,  my daughter sings, and my son plays the drums.  
          </P>
           <P> I am looking forward to completing this course and exploring the next chapter in my 
            professional development.
          </P>
